This is a great advice!\\r\\nTom: I will talk to my wife, but for now, I think we could focus on buying something similar size.\\r\\nDiana: How many rooms are you looking for?\\r\\nTom: Two bedrooms at least, joined kitchen and living room is fine as well.\\r\\nDiana: Do you have any preferred neighbourhood?\\r\\nTom: Anywhere near the tube station within zone 3 is acceptable.\\r\\nDiana: Thank you.
